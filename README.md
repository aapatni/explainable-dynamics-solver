## Motivation

The paper focuses on the challenge of enhancing the explainability of SINDy Autoencoders, a machine learning technique used to model dynamical systems. While SINDy Autoencoders can generate interpretable ordinary differential equations (ODEs) from time series data, they face difficulties in making the coordinate generation part, handled by neural networks, interpretable. This lack of interpretability is problematic for domain experts who need a clear physical understanding of the coordinates or features used in their models.

## Target Users

The target audience for this work primarily includes domain experts and researchers in various fields who use SINDy Autoencoders to understand dynamical systems.

## Methodology

The methodology proposed in the paper revolves around creating explanations that clarify the meaning of the learned coordinate system. Since scientific data often comes in the form of images or videos, the goal is to establish a 1-to-1 visualization between the learned coordinates and spatial features. For instance, if the original data represents geometric shapes, the coordinates could be replaced with images of those shapes. The explanations are generated using techniques like Grad-Cam/explanation by example or alternative dimensionality reduction methods that prioritize interpretability.
